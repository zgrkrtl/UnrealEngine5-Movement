# Unreal Engine 5 Movement

# Movement Mechanics in Mercenary

## Overview
In this section, I will describe the movement mechanics I've implemented in [Mercenary]. The focus has been on creating a fluid and responsive 8-way locomotion system via animations from Mixamo.
## Takeaways
-I seperated Controls from Character class every input action defined in PlayerController class 

-I used enhanced input system 

-I implemented simple GAS(GameplayAbilitySystem) Collectibles and FireArea

-I simply implemented Model View Controller Architecture(MVC) for user interface - Just Progress bar for now

-This work focused on movement and how can it be better with limited assets consisted.
